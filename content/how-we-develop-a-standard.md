# {{ page.title }}

If you think you need a data standard, we need you to be able to answer some questions for us upfront.

What we need to know first:
* what do people want to use the data for?
* which questions do people want the data to answer for them?
* who will use the data?
* who will create the data?
* who owns the data - who’s the trusted source or domain expert?
* does any data currently exist?
* is there legislation for this policy/concept?
* who’s the policy lead and what policy area does it relate to?

What we’ll need later on:
* a list of all organisations that need to publish the data
* category data
