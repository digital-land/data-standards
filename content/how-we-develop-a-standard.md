# {{ page.title }}

If you think you need a data standard, we need you to be able to answer some questions for us upfront.

We need to know first:
* what do people want to use the data for?
* which questions do people want the data to answer for them?
* who will use the data?
* who will create the data?
* who owns the data - who’s the trusted source or domain expert?
* does any data currently exist?
* is there legislation for this policy/concept?
* who’s the policy lead and what policy area does it relate to?

What we’ll need later on:
* a list of all organisations that need to publish the data
* category data 

## What a data standard won’t do

A data standard won’t in itself answer questions for you. It provides the raw ingredients to help you get the answers.

A data standard doesn’t guarantee data quality. The quality of data ultimately depends on how well the standard is implemented and followed, as well as the quality of the data collection process itself.  

Standards help shape consistency - but can’t make any judgement in terms of accuracy. For example it can fix spelling errors, but can’t tell whether a site has been entered in the correct location.

Data standards are not fixed or static, they evolve. A data standard needs to be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.
