## Background and purpose

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is developing data standards to make land and housing data easier to find, understand, use and trust. 

We believe this will lead to: 
* better planning decisions 
* fewer uncertainties and delays in the housing system 
* more new digital services for property and planning 
* better relationships between communities and developments
  
Our platform collects planning and housing data from local planning authorities (LPAs) and other organisations and transforms it into a consistent state, across England. Anyone can view, download and analyse the data we hold. 

A data standard is a formal document that defines how data should be structured, formatted, stored and published in a consistent way.
Each standard provides a set of rules and guidelines for producing and organising that data, ensuring that it can be read and understood by other systems without any confusion or errors.

## How we develop a standard
If you think you need a data standard, we’ll need you to provide us with certain information to start with - we’ll need your domain expertise.
We’ll then run our data design process so we can understand the data need for the planning consideration and gather enough information to start working on a data model.
We’ll then publish a technical specification for the data model we’re working on at the earliest possible opportunity.
Ways of working
We’re a multidisciplinary team consisting of interaction, service and content designers, data experts, delivery managers and business analysts. 

We publish details of what we’re working on on our website as well as publishing our regular weeknotes.

To get in touch with our team, just drop Matt Lucht an email.

## What we need from you
One of the most important things we need to help you with your data standards is support understanding the domain/subject/planning policy area.

We’ll need help to understand:
* where it is used in the planning system and associated processes
* who needs the data and how they might use it (we’ll help you turn this into user needs)
  
We’ll also need your help to access people working in the domain who’ll be the people responsible for creating and publishing the data.

If the data requires pre-defined constrained lists of allowable values (for example planning application types) we’ll need you to define that list of values. These lists will need to be maintained and you’ll need to nominate someone to do that too.

We’ll also need sample data - if this does not already exist we will need to work with you to create some that we can use to test the data model.
And lastly, we’ll need a list of who (organisations) will be expected to publish data that complies with this standard.

## What you can expect from us

Once we have worked together with you to get all the information we need, we’ll provide you with:

* a data model defined to satisfy the user needs we’ve established with you
* a data model that follows the principles of other datasets on planning.data.gov.uk
* a data model tested with sample data
* a rationale for what is included in the data model/standard
* a technical specification for the standard
* a recommendation for how to pilot the standard
