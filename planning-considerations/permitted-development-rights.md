### Why are we looking at it

Permitted development rights (PDRs) allow householders to improve and extend their homes without the need to apply for planning permission where that would be out of proportion with the impact of works carried out.

But there are other planning considerations, such as [article 4 directions](/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/planning-consideration/article-4-directions/) that impact what PDRs are allowed or removed in an area or for a property.

It is important to be able to use and refer to the PDRs in data in a consistent way.

### What weâ€™ve done

We've created the main [permitted development right schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-land/specification/main/content/dataset/permitted-development-right.md).

We also needed to create a category-type dataset called [permitted development right part](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-land/specification/main/content/dataset/permitted-development-right-part.md).

The [Permitted development right data](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/permitted-development-right) we created as a starting point is available on [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk).

### Whats next

We created this dataset in 2018 and it is now out of date. As well as updating the dataset we are looking for a data custodian to manage the dataset so that it does not become outdated again.
