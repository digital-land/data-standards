### Why are we looking at it

When granting some planning applications Local planning authorities can "granted with conditions" - these conditions, what we call planning conditions, become restrictions on any future development that can be done on a property/site.

Therefore it is important for anyone hoping to develop a site or property to be able to understand what conditions apply.

We think it would be useful to make these conditions available as data in a consistent way.

### What weâ€™ve done

We have done some [research into planning conditions with a handful of local planning authorities](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/40#discussioncomment-6692414). This gave us enough information to start development a [data model for planning conditions](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNRvkj-0=/?share_link_id=792454785167).

This draft model has been shared publically and is open for feedback and comments.

We have also set up a working group for planning conditions.

### Whats next

We plan to give people some time to comment on the initial draft data model. We'll then follow up on any comments and see what changes we need to make.

In the meantime we need to start planning a small pilot where we can work with a handful of local planning authorities to test whether the model (the current or amended model) is a) achievable and b) yields data that satisfies the user needs we have identified.

Based on feedback from the working group and local planning authorities we've spoken to this pilot will concentrate on conditions that remove permitted development rights.
