## Updating our collection of brownfield land data

We’ve been working on bringing our [brownfield land data](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/brownfield-land) up-to-date. Of the 339 local planning authorities we identified that 117 new sources of data needed to be added. So far, the team have been able to add 82 of these and there are around 15 sources of data that are problematic and require us to speak with the relevant LPA.

* We have created a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/digital-land/jupyter-analysis/blob/main/service_report/service_report.ipynb) which we will use as an mvp for reporting on the health of our data. Currently it focuses on analysing the health of the endpoints which data publishers have provided us.

* We have refactored our primary application’s frontend code base to increase the stability of the site.

* To help us manage content changes to the website we’ve created a [‘content workflow’](https://trello.com/b/KY2rfd4u/content-requests) process using Trello. We’ll use this process to help us prioritise and progress any content changes on the site.

## Testing the specification for planning applications

* We’ve been testing our draft [planning application specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/planning-application/) by attempting to collect data from 3 local planning authorities who are already publishing application data (albeit in a non-standardised way). We were interested to learn to what extent does the existing data meet the standard we’re proposing.
** So far we’ve been able collect ~100,000 planning application records from [Camden](https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Environment/Planning-Applications/2eiu-s2cw), [Adur & Worthing](https://www.adur-worthing.gov.uk/datasets/#planning), and [Nottingham](https://www.opendatanottingham.org.uk/dataset.aspx?id=28)
** Their data was available in a mixture of .csv and GeoJson formats
** Whilst we were able to turn the three sets of data into a single coherent dataset that process was quite laborious so will require further conversations to test the feasibility of LPAs publishing to our draft standard
