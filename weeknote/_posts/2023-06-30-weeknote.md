## Storming, Forming, Norming, Performing

We were joined by Rachael Harvey, our new Product Manager for our platform and data operations. Scott set out our new single service team structure in [our public weeknotes](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/weeknote/2023/06/30/weeknote.html).
    
*structure*

The team are closer to norming on [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development).

## Combining user story and value stream mapping

Paul D gave the team a quick introduction to[Value Stream Mapping](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SU-0glP2Dk67IJIaqd5U2hwsaA7kf3Dgw5qGtgbPXow/edit?usp=sharing) and how visualising the service will help us meet our goal to [make data faster](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/beta-team/#but-will-it-make-data-faster).

Sarah worked with Paul, Colm, Petrea and Swati to develop a service map which relates to our process map as a Mural board. The team are now contributing questions and data to the board. We particularly need to see the sizes of queues and the time data waits between processing so we can priorise the work needed to reduce the time it takes us to get data into the hands of our users.

Combining [User Story Mapping](https://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/) with [Value Stream Mapping(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping) is an emergent practice. We will share what we learn.

## Visualising and stablising our operations

Swati worked with the developers to visualise our processing so we can prioritise our most pressing issues. We keep a lot of data about our processing, much of which is available in our [datasette API](https://datasette.planning.data.gov.uk/).  This means we can quickly create reports on how we're performing, such as this [Jupyter notebooks](https://gist.github.com/psd/725ec25dcec962db6037b687aa214fa1) to visualise how many collection errors we have each month.

The developers continued work to stabilise our platform. Ernest added alerts from our [canary deployments](https://www.opsmx.com/blog/what-is-canary-deployment/) to our slack channel. They're a little noisy, but give us greater visiibility of our operations which is our focus for this sprint.
