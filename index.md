# Data standards team

The Data Standards team are creating data standards for planning.

This process includes:

- opening up the planning system through data
- discovering what planning processes can be modelled in data
- learning how to scale our processes
- building data capability within DLUHC and local planning authorities

You can follow our progress by reading [our weeknotes](weeknote)
